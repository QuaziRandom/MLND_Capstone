This folder contains few sample images obtained from Google street view. The multi-digit recognition model is run on these samples and the results are stored in [multi_digit_recognition](/sample/multi_digit_recognition). Manually cropped versions of these images are also run on the model that doesn't localize digits in the image and are stored in [multi_digit_recognition_wo_localization](/sample/multi_digit_recognition_wo_localization). 

The images inside [google_street_view_images](/sample/google_street_view_images) are derived from the short-link to the location in Google map from where the particular image is obtained. For example, [BgjeYc.png](/sample/google_street_view_images/BgjeYc.png) corresponds to [https://goo.gl/BgjeYc](https://goo.gl/BgjeYc).

**Note: Google may own copyrights to some or all of the street view images.**
